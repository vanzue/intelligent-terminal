# Release checklist §8 (C270, C271) — hooks installed by an OLDER Intelligent
# Terminal must keep working against a newer one.
#
# PR #571 replaced the PowerShell hook bridge with `wtcli agent-hook`, but that
# only changes the bundle Terminal SHIPS. The bundle a user already INSTALLED is
# a copy inside their CLI's plugin cache; upgrading Terminal never rewrites it,
# and the auto-upgrade that should can fail outright — `<cli> plugin install`
# replaces the whole plugin directory, which Windows refuses while a CLI process
# holds a handle on it (observed as "Access is denied (os error 5)"). So "old
# hooks, new Terminal" is a state real users sit in, sometimes for a long time.
#
# It keeps working only because `wtcli send-event` — the subcommand the legacy
# script calls — was left in place. Nothing else in the tree records that this
# is load-bearing, so deleting it as "superseded by agent-hook" would break
# every un-refreshed user with no other test going red. That is the silent
# dependency these two cases exist to make loud.
#
# The fixture under test/e2e/fixtures/legacy-hook-bundle is a verbatim copy of
# the pre-#571 bundle and must never be edited. See its README.

                The command line the legacy bundle really shipped for one WTA topic,
                with the plugin-root placeholder pointed at the fixture.
            .DESCRIPTION
                Read from the frozen hooks.json rather than retyped here: the exact
                spelling — `powershell` (not pwsh), -NonInteractive, -ExecutionPolicy
                Bypass, -CliSource, the positional event — is the thing under test, and
                a hand-copied approximation would quietly stop matching it.
