# Release checklist §8 — the hook bundle must work when a REAL agent CLI fires it.
#
# Feature.HookTrace (C190) proves the bridge itself: it types `wtcli agent-hook` into a pane and
# asserts the published event. That deliberately bypasses the two layers the bundle actually ships:
# the agent CLI's own hook executor, and the Windows shell that CLI dispatches the `hooks.json`
# `command` string through. Both layers are where PR #571 regressed — Copilot dispatches hooks
# through PowerShell, where a command starting with a quoted path is a parse error, and because
# Copilot's PreToolUse hook is FAIL-CLOSED that error denied every tool call in the session
# ("Denied by preToolUse hook ... (hook errored)").
#
# Unit tests (`bundled_hook_commands_run_in_every_shell`) now execute the shipped command
# lines in each CLI's shell, but they cannot prove that the CLI accepts the bundle or that a
# broken hook does not take the agent down with it. That is what these three cases add:
# a working bundle, a bridge that cannot reach Terminal, and a bridge that is gone from PATH
# entirely — the state an Intelligent Terminal uninstall leaves behind.
#
# The oracle is deliberately LLM-independent: SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit fire on every prompt
# regardless of what the model decides to do, so a model that answers without calling a tool
# cannot make this test flap.
