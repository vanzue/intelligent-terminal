//! Cross-language contract test for the agent hook bridge.
//!
//! Agent CLI lifecycle hooks reach WTA through a producer that lives in a
//! different language: `BuildAgentHookEventJson` in
//! `src/tools/wtcli/wtcli_functions.h` reads the hook JSON from stdin, redacts
//! it, and publishes an `agent_event` over COM. The consumer —
//! `app::route_agent_event_to_registry_with_hook_sink` — then reads specific
//! members back out of that payload.
//!
//! The producer therefore encodes, in C++, knowledge that is owned by the Rust
//! consumer:
//!
//!   * which payload members survive redaction, and
//!   * which `tool_name` values are "the agent is asking the user something"
//!     (only those keep `tool_input`).
//!
//! Nothing in the type system, the build, or the fuzzer ties those two sides
//! together, and every failure mode is **silent**: over-redaction doesn't
//! error, it just makes a field arrive empty, so the session row quietly shows
//! a blank cwd or "waiting for user input" instead of the real question. This
//! module is the missing red light.
//!
//! Like `locale_parity_tests`, the check is intentionally dependency-free. The
//! two C++ arrays are plain lists of string literals with no macros or
//! conditional compilation, so scanning for quoted tokens between `name[] = {`
//! and `};` is exact. If that ever stops being true, the extraction panics
//! with a pointer to this comment rather than silently matching nothing.
